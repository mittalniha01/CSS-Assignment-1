  <h3>What is CSS?</h3>
  <ol>
      <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
      <br>
      <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper,or in another media.</li>
      <br>
      <li><span id="box">CSS is not necessary.</span><span class="main">CSS saves a lot of work.</span> It can control the layouts of multiple web pages all at once</li>
      <br>
      <li><i>External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</i></li>
  </ol>
  <h3>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h3>
  <div>
  <ul>
    <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements</li>
    <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
    <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
    <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files.However,<span class="main">in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span>because this is easier to demonstrate,and easier to try it yourself.</li>
  </ul>
</div>
  <p>When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS applies a style to multiple elements. ID on the other hand,applies a style to one unique element. Id is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it is used by JS</p>
  <p>In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements ona web page. Once an element has been targeted, style or set of styles can be applied to an element</p>
  <p>There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID.Both are used to target elements to which a stylesheet be applied.</p>
